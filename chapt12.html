                <br><p>Introduction <br> <br> 
Nadine Gordimer (20 November 1923 – 13 July 2014) was a South African writer, political activist and recipient of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature. She was recognized as a woman "who through her magnificent epic writing has – in the words of Alfred Nobel – been of very great benefit to humanity".<br> <br> 
 Gordimer's writing dealt with themes of love, politics, moral and racial issues, particularly apartheid in South Africa. Her works always question power relations and truth, she tells stories of ordinary people, revealing moral ambiguities and choices. Her characterization is nuanced, revealed more through the choices her characters make than through their claimed identities and beliefs. She also weaves in subtle details within the characters' names. Under that regime, works such as Burger's Daughter and July's People were banned. She was active in the anti-apartheid movement, joining the African National Congress during the days when the organization was banned, and gave Nelson Mandela advice on his famous 1964 defense speech at the trial which led to his conviction for life. She was also active in HIV/AIDS causes. <br> <br> 
 About the short story “Amnesty” <br> <br> 
 “Amnesty” describes the miserable conditions black people in her country had to cope with for several years. The story is at the same time both sad and encouraging, because it describes the enormous courage and will of the blacks to fight against apartheid, the inhuman practice of racial segregation practiced in South Africa since the beginning of the last century. The story takes place in South Africa during the time of apartheid. <br> <br> 
 Summary<br> <br> 
 A young woman narrates the story of her potential husband's freedom from imprisonment. The man, never named, had left their village on the grassy plains of South Africa nine years earlier to work as a construction worker among the unfinished tops of skyscrapers in an obscure but not too distant city. The woman had little contact with his urban life (for 2 years he sent home money and visited one weekend each month) but she learned he had joined a union. A bright man, he began making speeches and marching for the causes of workers and civil rights in general. In the third year she learned that he was in prison. During the trial that followed a baby daughter, which he named Inkululeko, was born. He was sentenced to 6 years on the "Island." She attempted to visit him once: she and his parents saved for 2 years and made the journey to Cape Town, but they got as far as the ferry because they had no permit. After 5 years, he has returned, changed. His young daughter doesn't recognize him from the old photo she has grown up with;  the narrator finds herself as distanced from this man maybe less sure of where his thoughts are as when he was away from her. Now, carrying a second child, she finishes the story, thinking figuratively that she's still waiting for him to come home. <br> <br>

 Racism is the main theme of the short story “Amnesty” by Nadine Gordimer. She explains the struggle of black South Africans to challenge apartheid. The entire South African people were divided according to races. This deep racial division made the life of common people horrible; mostly the women were emotionally and physically affected.

The policeman told they should bring a permit to visit a prisoner on the island. So they were sent away. <br> <br> IV. Answer the following questions in about 300 words: <br> <br>  1. Nadine Gordimer's “Amnesty” examines the struggle of the black South Africans to challenge the apartheid. Discuss. <br> <br>  "Amnesty," a short story by Nadine Gordimer, takes place in South Africa during the time of apartheid. The story is about a woman whose fiancé is imprisoned on the Island because of his political beliefs. At the end of the story, the woman is waiting for her fiancé's return and for a better life in South Africa. But much has changed in South Africa since the time in which this story takes place. The short story's settings cut across the whole spectrum of South African life. She writes about black village life and black urban experiences. Racism is the main theme of the short story “Amnesty”. The writer explains the struggle of black South Africans to challenge apartheid through a woman character. <br> <br>  The entire South African people were divided according to races. This deep racial division made the life of common people horrible, mostly women were the real victim of the events. They actually did not know the real situation and they were emotionally and physically affected. The land was owned by whites and the blacks are working for them, who were paid very poorly. The natives had no proper home and all the land belonged to the whites. The condition of the black people in their own country is very pathetic. The story is at the same time both sad and encouraging, because it describes the enormous courage and will of the blacks to fight against apartheid. <br> <br>  The men who raised their voice against the whites had been taken to prison and sentenced for long years without any reason. To visit a prisoners one should get special permission from police. The life of the prisoners is a horrible one, many prisoners died while they were in the island. The women, who were waiting for their beloved ones is a very common story in South Africa. They dream for a better future which is actually far away, however the struggle of the black south Africans to challenge the apartheid won't end till the last breath of their life. <br> <br>  2. Critically examine “Amnesty” as the story of a young woman whose ambitions are thwarted by social inequalities. <br> <br>  The story “Amnesty” by Nadine Gordimer is the story of a young woman whose ambitions are thwarted by social inequalities. The narrator is a woman, who had passed 8th standard and was working in a farm house to support her family. She has 3 brothers, two of them who worked in the town but they did not send money home and one brother who worked with her father for the Boer. The narrator's fiancée, the protagonist went nine years ago to a town to work in a construction company. For first two years he came home for vocations and the narrator’s father fixed their marriage after 3 years. Then she heard he had joined union and conducted strikes. Because of union activities he was arrested and sent to jail. During the trail they met and she became pregnant and had a baby whom he named Inkululeko. <br> <br> The narrator is a woman she had so many ambitions - she wanted to marry her beloved and live in her own house but her dreams were destroyed because of social inequalities. She tried to meet him in prison but because of lack of permission from police she missed that opportunity also. The protagonist always thought about the freedom of his society, but the young woman thought about the free life with her husband. In the end we see the narrator sitting alone in the late afternoon and talking to herself about the Boer's farm, which actually belongs to nobody. Everything is nothing on the back of the earth. The sun's colors are changing in the sky and it going to be evening soon. She was waiting for his arrival and for a better life in South Africa.
