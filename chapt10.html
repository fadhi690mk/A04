Summary<br> <br> 
 The narrator was kneeling long after the congregation on his feet, by dipping both hands into holy water and he traced the trinity crossed his chest and uttered prayer for the first time in a glass-stained cathedral. His tiny body drooping like a question mark and asked Jesus to fix it, but didn't get answer. He befriended silence in the hopes that his sin would burn and salve his mouth dissolved like sugar on tongue, but shame lingered as an aftertaste. To reintroduce him to sanctity, his mother told him that he was the miracle and told he could choose to be anything he wants when he grow up. So he decided to be a boy. It was cute and used skinned knees as was the custom and played hide and seek with his goal. <br> <br> 
 He won the game which other kids couldn’t play, he was the mystery of an anatomy, because he was neither fully a boy nor a girl - a question asked but not answered. So he tried to balance between awkward boy and apologetic girl, and when he turned 12, the boy phase wasn’t deemed cute anymore. So he wore skirts because his nostalgic aunts reminded that if he went on with boys kind of attitude he would never bring a husband home. He swallowed their insults along with their slurs. Naturally the narrator refused to reveal his secret, but the kids in his school found some truth and called him lesbian. He was more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie. <br> <br> 
 He did not hate his body he just loved it enough to let it go, because the body is considered a house and did not want to evacuate. His mother fears he would fade away like Mya Hall, Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington - who either committed suicide or were shot dead. And people will speak of him as “what a shame!” the mother claims that then he would turned into walking coffin and all news headlines would turn his identity into a spectacle. People like him are left out when the societies discuss about equality of gender, as he belongs to neither group. <br> <br> 
No one ever thinks of them as human because they are more ghost than flesh, people fear that their gender expression is a trick, that it exists to be perverse, that it ensnares them without their consent. His body is a feast for their eyes and hands and once they have fed off his queer, they’ll regurgitate all the parts they did not like. Then they’ll put him back into the closet, hang him with all the other skeletons and he will be the best attraction. <br> <br> 
 He wonders how long it will be before the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant. They are transgender not because of their sin and so should love their body. He prayed long for the answer but dir not receive and his blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus’ feet. His prayers are now getting stuck in his throat. Maybe he feels finally he had fixed, because he understands that that is how God wants him, so he don't care any-more. He accept whatever God has decided and don't have any complaint. <br> <br>  EXERCISES <br> <br>
