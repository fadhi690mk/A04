of India. The terms sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic and republic in the Preamble suggests
the nature of the state. The ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity reflect the objectives of
the Constitution. The independence of India earned through struggle for independence is sought to

of the word ‘socialist’ in the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment. To emphasize these values the
Constitution framers have resorted to the use of the concepts like justice, liberty, equality and
fraternity. The unity and integrity of the nation is sought to secured in the Preamble and by the
provisions of fundamental duties and single citizenship in the Constitution. The Preamble
embodies the basic philosophy and fundamental values on which the Constitution is based. It very
well reflects the dreams and aspirations of the founding fathers of the Constitution.<br>
<br>IV. Answer the following questions in about 300 words:<br>
<br>1. Explain the salient features of the Preamble of the Constitution of India.<br>
The term ‘Preamble’ refers to the introduction or preface to the Constitution. The
significance of the Preamble lies in its components. It embodies the source of the Constitution i.e.,
the people of India. The terms sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic and republic in the
Preamble suggest the nature of the state. The ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity
reflect the objectives of the Constitution. It also contains November 26, 1949 as the date of
adoption of the Indian Constitution.
<br>The philosophy of the Indian Constitution is reflected in the Preamble. The independence of
India earned through struggle for independence is sought to be emphasized by the use of the word
‘Sovereign’ in the Preamble. The Gandhian ideals are aimed to be secured by the incorporation of
the word ‘Socialist’ in the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment. The same amendment inserted the
word ‘Secular’ to reflect the secular nature of Indian society. The word ‘Republic’ in the
Preamble indicates that India has an elected head, though indirectly elected, the Indian President
is the choice of the people of India. These values are further strengthened by the word
‘Democratic’ in the Preamble. To emphasize these values the Constitution framers have resorted
to the use of the concepts like justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. Social, economic and
political justice are to be secured through the provisions of Fundamental Rights. Liberty is 
guaranteed to the individuals through the provision of Fundamental Rights, which are enforceable
in the court of law.
<br>The unity and integrity of the nation is sought to be secured by the use of the word
‘Fraternity’ in the Preamble and by the provisions of fundamental duties and single citizenship in
the Constitution. The use of these words in the Preamble shows that it embodies the basic
philosophy and fundamental values on which the Constitution is based. It very well reflects the
dreams and aspirations of the founding fathers of the Constitution. The claim that the constitution
is derived from the people is justified because of its broad-based popular acceptance ever since it
came into force.
<br>The very first sentence of the preamble declares India to be a Sovereign Socialist
Democratic Republic. The term ‘sovereign’ implies that India is internally supreme and externally
free. State authority of India is supreme over all men and all associations within India’s territorial
boundary. This is India’s internal sovereignty. The terms socialist and secular were added to the
Preamble by 42nd amendment in 1976. Secularism is a glaring necessity in India’s socio-political
context. Inhabited by people of all faiths, it is imperative that India does not accept any religion as
the state-religion. India’s secularism ensures that religious minorities do not suffer from a sense of
inferiority as do the minority communities in Pakistan or Bangladesh. The terms ‘Democratic’
and ‘Republic‘ in the Preamble are very important. India’s aim is to build up not only a
democratic political system but also a democratic social system.
<br>India joined the Commonwealth by her “free will.” In India popular elections give
legitimacy to our rulers. A system is republican where no office of the state is held on the basis of
hereditary prescriptive rights. In India every office of the state from the highest to the lowest is
open to every citizen. Any citizen may occupy any office on the basis of merit. Thus, headship of
the state is not hereditary as in England, nor is it based on military power as in dictatorial regimes.
<br>To build up an ideal democracy, the Preamble emphasizes justice, liberty, equality and
fraternity as political ideals. These ideals listed in the Preamble are, according to Prof. Barker, the
quintessence of western democracy. The ideal of justice implies a system where individuals can
realize their full potentialities. In the view of our founding fathers it is not enough that there is
political or legal justice. Political and legal justice is a myth unless accompanied by social and
economic justice. Social justice implies that all social discriminations like caste differentiation
must be ended. Economic justice implies that economic exploitations should be ended. However,
social and economic justice still remain unrealized dreams. The ideal of liberty aims at ensuring
these freedoms which make men really free. Liberty to be meaningful must mean liberty of
thought, expression, belief, faith and worship.
The idea of equality is aimed at removing discriminations between citizens. This is
particularly important in the Indian society, vitiated by caste system and untouchability. But here
again one should remember that equality in the social arena is bound to be empty unless
accompanied by economic equality. Finally, fraternity as an ideal is sought to be fostered to
ensure the dignity of the individual and unity of the nation. One should however note that a
fraternal feeling among Indians would grow only in proportion to the realization of the ideals of
justice, liberty and equality
