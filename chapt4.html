<br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
Rabindranath Tagore was one of the prominent figures of nineteenth century Bengal, India. In addition to his many sided literary activities, he was also interested in the common people and worked for social reform. He started an experimental school at Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education. He was also a part of the Indian Nationalist Movement. For the world he became the voice of India’s spiritual heritage; and for India especially for Bengal, he became a great living institution. <br>                                                                                                                                         
 In the poem ‘Freedom’ through his non-sentimental and visionary approach he states the need for freedom to begin from each and every individual heart and then it could be felt in the airs. <br>

<br>                                                                                                                                         
 3. What is referred to as “burden of ages”? <br>

<br>                                                                                                                                         
 III. Answer the following questions in a paragraph: <br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
 1. Images of Colonialism in “Freedom” <br>                                                                                                                                         
 Tagore’s “Freedom”is set in thepolitical scenario of India under British rule. The call for urgency of freedom is evident throughout the poem, and this call for freedom is demanded through various images of colonized India. India was under various imperial powers. India was a colony not only to Britain but also to earlier colonizers like the Dutch, French and Portuguese. India is compared to an Old woman, the motherland, who has bend due to the burden of age old customs and social evils she is carrying. Due to continuous overpowering of foreign powers her back is breaking. In the following lines India is even compared to a sail boat aimlessly floating and also to a puppet dancing to the instructions of thoughtless master. <br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
 2. Patriotism a theme in Tagore’s “Freedom” <br>                                                                                                                                         
Tagore’s patriotism is clear in the opening lines itself. The poem is concerned with India’s freedom struggle. Tagore calls out to the motherland to free from fear, from the shackles of oppression, from fear of the outsiders. The reader experiences the weight of colonial powers from which Tagore seeks to save his beloved country. Tagore’s patriotism permeates this poem as he decries the “master” beneath whom his “motherland” serves as a “puppet”-but in truth as a slave. Freedom is where the mind is without fears. <br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
IV. Answer the following questions in about 300 words. <br>                                                                                                                                         
 1. Define the concept of freedom based on Tagore’s “Freedom”. <br>                                                                                                                                         
 Freedom is a patriotic poem by Tagore, The Bard of Bengal. He bought fame by being the first non European to get the Nobel prize in Literature in 1913, especially by his outstanding book ‘Gitanjali’. <br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
                  Through the alliterative use of the ‘f’ sound in the words ‘freedom’, ‘from’ and ‘fear’, he emphasizes the urgency of his call for Indian independence. The word “freedom” is repeated throughout, to express the poet’s deep wish for independence from the oppression of imperial powers. He represents his motherland as aged, breaking her back, blinding her eyes. India doesn’t foresee a bright future because she is kept submissive by colonial powers. <br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
            India is stagnant from the shackles that bind her. Tagore insists her to break free from oppression. India should awaken from the long slumber of inertness and seek future promises. She should abide by truth alone and her victory is not far. One must not succumb to such adverse destiny but sail away from “blind uncertain winds”. Here India is compared to a sail ship which floats in response to thoughtless commands of the whites, repeating the same mistakes. A master and slave picture is given by comparing India to a puppet in imperial hands, whose moves are determined by the master. India must seek freedom from the insult of being a puppet under the brainless master’s control. Thus true life is not lived here when movements and habits are watched and controlled. Unless there is freedom, the country can never progress. <br>                                                                                                                                         
<br>                                                                                                                                         
        India should have the courage to throw away the White establishments because they are least bothered about the welfare of Indians. Unless we shake of this fear, the shackles that tie us to darkness and ignorance will bind us even harder. An unreal life is being led under the rule of foreigners in one’s own land. Tagore makes use of appropriate metaphors to evoke patriotic spirit in the reader. <br>
