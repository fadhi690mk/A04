Zlateh is the pet goat of the family. Reuven decides to sell Zlateh to the town butcher Feyvel as it has become old and gave little milk and mostly because the family wanted money to celebrate for Hanukkah which is near. When Aaron the eldest boy bound a rope around Zlateh’s neck it stood as patiently and good naturedly as ever. It trusted human beings because they have always fed him and have never harmed him. It was a little confused when it was taken along the road to the town because it has never been led that way before. On the day Zlateh is being taken to the town the family grieves. Aaron takes it to the town and there occurs a heavy snow storm. Both Aaron and Zlateh couldn’t make their way through the snow. Luckily they find a large hay stack and make room to shelter inside it so that they are protected from the turbulent weather outside. For three continuous days they stay there and in these three days Aaron realizes that his love for Zlateh has grown into an inseparable bond and she seems like family to him. <br><br>
 Aaron decides not to sell Zlateh as she has saved him by providing her milk to quench his hunger. Zlateh also feels grateful to Aaron for saving her from the heavy snow and providing her ample hay. After their return home Zlateh is treated majestically. <br><br>

 2. The communication between Aaron and his goat. <br><br>
 During the four days sheltering in a stack of hay Zlateh realized there was an inseparable bond between him and his goat. He felt lonely and missed his family. He had always loved Zlateh but now she seemed to be like a sister. He wanted to talk to someone and started talking to Zlateh. To every sentence Aaron made she just replied in her single sound “maa”. She can’t speak but she understood what Aaron told her. Her language consisted of only one sound, but many meanings. <br><br>
 3. Compare the character of Zlateh and Aaron. <br><br>
 Zlateh is the family pet goat. It is so bonded with the family members. It is patient and good- natured. Zlateh trusted human beings because she knew that they always fed her and never did any harm. It believes so because no one in the family has caused any harm to it. Aaron doesn’t want to sell Zlateh, but he has to obey his father who has decided to sell Zlateh off for eight gulden. Zlateh innocently follows Aaron through the unfamiliar road to town. After their challenging way out of snow they are both grateful to each other. <br><br>
 4. The days Aaron and his goat spent inside the haystack. <br><br>
 Aaron hollowed out a nest for himself and the goat. He also bored a window through the hay and snow and kept the passage clear. Zlateh was hungry and eagerly ate the hay around. Aaron ate the two slices of bread and cheese that he had with him. He was still hungry and drank his goat’s milk. When he felt lonely he would talk to Zlateh and she would reply with her usual “maaa”. At night the snow had blocked up the window. He dreamed of summers while in the haystack. <br><br>
 5. The change of weather in Singer’s Zlateh the goat. <br><br>
 In the beginning of the story it is said that year the winter was mild. It was almost the time of Hanukkah but there was only little snow. The peasants complained that because of the dry weather there would be poor harvest of winter grain. It was a bad year for Reuven . But on the day Zlateh was taken to sell, there occurred heavy snow storm continuously for three days. Though the three days of snow storm was difficult for Zlateh and Aaron, it turned out to bring good days for him and his family. Zlateh was saved and they decided to never sell it off, the bond between Aaron and Zlateh grew even stronger. It also conveys that the windy snowy days are to bring good for the peasants and the furrier. <br><br>

Reuven decides to sell Zlateh to the town butcher Feyvel as it has become old and gave little milk and mostly because the family wanted money to celebrate for Hanukkah which is near. When Aaron the eldest boy bound a rope around Zlateh’s neck it stood as patiently and good naturedly as ever. It trusted human beings because they have always fed him and has never harmed him. It was a little confused when it was taken along the road to the town because it has never been led that way before. On the day Zlateh is being taken to the town the family grieves.
