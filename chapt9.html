                <br><p>Introduction<br><br> 
 Kate Chopin was born in St. Louis, Missouri (1851-1904), was an American author of short stories and novels based in Louisiana. She is now considered by some scholars to have been a forerunner of American 20th-century feminist authors of Southern or Catholic background. She married Oscar Chopin and moved with her husband to New Orleans. They later lived in the country in Cloutierville, Louisiana. From 1892 to 1895, Chopin wrote short stories for both children and adults that were published in such national magazines as Atlantic Monthly, Vogue, The Century Magazine, and The Youth's Companion. Her stories aroused controversy because of her subjects and her approach; they were condemned as immoral by some critics. <br> <br> 
 Her major works were two short story collections: Bayou Folk (1894) and A Night in Acadie (1897). Her important short stories included "Désirée’s Baby" (1893), a tale of miscegenation in antebellum Louisiana, "The Story of an Hour" (1894), and "The Storm"(1898). "The Storm" is a sequel to "At the Cadian Ball," which appeared in her first collection of short stories, Bayou Folk. Chopin also wrote two novels: At Fault (1890) and The Awakening (1899), which are set in New Orleans and Grand Isle, respectively. <br> <br> 
About the short story: <br> <br> 
 "The Story of an Hour" ,published in 1894 (originally published in Vogue as “The Dream of an Hour”) is a brilliant exploration of the concept of marriage as a site of confinement. Many women were fighting for the right to vote and to hold jobs. Chopin's depiction of female self- assertion was regarded as immoral. Kate lived in a male-dominated society where women were second-class citizens. Women were believed to be fragile creatures that needed a man in order to survive and be happy. Society saw women as selfless wives and mothers. <br> <br>
  Summary <br> <br> 
The story is about a woman, Mrs. Mallard, whose husband unexpectedly dies in a railroad disaster. Her sister and her husband's friend break the news gently to her because Mrs. Mallard has a heart disease, and they are concerned that the shock may be too much for her. Mrs. Mallard immediately falls to weeping and goes up to her room. Once there and sitting in her comfortable chair and looking out the open window at the patch of blue sky showing through the opening in the clouds, she suddenly realizes that she is not entirely sad, that, in fact, she finally feels free for the first time in her life. When she opens the door to her sister and begins down the stairs, her husband, Brently, shows up. He hadn't been in the accident after all. Upon seeing him, Louise Mallard (who never had a name of her own before her husband's "death") drops dead. The doctor says she died from too much joy. <br> <br> 
KEY CHARACTERS: <br> <br> 
 Louise Mallard, a wife who has suppressed her desire for independence, begins to understand her need for self-discovery when she learns of her husband’s death.      <br> <br> 
Josephine, sister of Louise Mallard, an ideal female who cares for her sister, that she carefully breaks the news of Mr. Mallard’s demise, offering comfort to Louise Mallard. <br> <br> 
 Brently Mallard, by all accounts a loving husband, is presumed dead in a railroad disaster; the report, however, is mistaken, and he reappears at the story’s end, causing his wife’s fatal heart attack. <br> <br> 
 Mr. Richards is the family friend who brings the news of Mr. Mallard’s death and attempts to screen Louise from the shock of his reappearance. <br> <br> 
 THE SYMBOLS <br> <br> 
1. "The Story of an Hour" is meant to symbolize the freedom and happiness that Louise Mallard has longed for throughout her marriage, perhaps even throughout her entire life. <br> <br> 
 2. Mrs. Mallard's heart trouble is a symbol of the way in which she feels crushed and imprisoned by her marriage. Her heart trouble is not just physical, it is also psychological in nature. <br> <br> 
 3. The doors are another symbols in the story: Mrs. Mallard's bedroom, the open window, and the front door of her house each represent a part of what happens to Mrs. Mallard during this eventful "story of an hour." <br> <br> 
 4. The "new spring life": symbolizes of her new life, free from her husband. <br> <br> 
 5. The "open square" she sees outside her window: is a symbol of freedom. <br> <br> 
6. The hint of the sound of a man singing: represents happiness, happiness that Louise Mallard seems to have been deprived of, at the very least, in her marriage. <br> <br> 
7. The sparrows that Mrs. Mallard hears in the trees are also symbols of the freedom she has long desired. <br> <br>

 LITERARY DEVICES<br> <br> 
 Simile<br> 
 She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams. The use of the word "as" in this quote to identify the simile compares the way Mrs. Mallard is sitting and sobbing intermittently to a child sleeping. <br> <br> 
 Irony <br> 
According to the doctor, Louise "has died of heart disease -- of the joy that kills." The doctor has assumed that Louise's heart could not withstand the excitement of learning that her husband was alive. However, Louise is grief-stricken to learn that he is alive because she has lost her freedom. This reveals how confined women often felt in society and in their marriages during this time period. The brief time Louise relishes her future opportunities is enough to make her lose her will to live. <br> <br> 
 Foreshadowing<br> 
 It is the use of clues that hint at future events. The very first sentence hints at Mrs. Mallard's ultimate fate. It is revealed that she has "heart trouble" and her sister is careful in breaking the news that Mrs. Mallard's husband has supposedly been killed in a "railroad disaster." At the end of the story, she does indeed die of "heart disease." <br> <br>

 It is assumed that she died of "the joy that kills." The witnesses assume she was so happy to see her husband alive that she died of the shock. Readers know that she is shocked to learn that the future that she had just dreamed of, all sorts of days that would be her own, will now be impossible. III. Answer the following questions in a paragraph: 1. The treatment of gender in “The Story of an Hour”. Kate Chopin's story of Mrs. Mallard's one hour of freedom defines the repression of a woman under patriarchy and the potential of this female outside of such a restrictive structure of principles and ideals. The story focuses on the treatment of gender in society and more specifically after marriages. The story provides a proper definition of what it means to be free and happy. Mrs. Mallard represents the numerous women who silently bear the feelings of being trapped in marriage. She had no identity or worth to society other than as the daughter of a father and the wife of a husband. For one hour Mrs. Mallard feels a growing sense of autonomy and worth as she has been given independence and control of her life by the news of her husband's death. Louise Mallard has a working husband who seems to love her, she has every material thing she could want. However, it is not until she receives news of Brently Mallard's death that she starts to realize she has been given a great gift of freedom. She had not even known it was out there, had not understood what she had been living without all those years. <br> <br> 
2. Chopin's treatment of marriage and family. <br> <br> 
This short story focuses on the treatment of marriage and family more specifically women's identity after her marriages. Women were owned by their husbands and had no control over their own lives. The protagonist's oppression is shown in the first sentence where she is named "Mrs. Mallard", she is only referred to as the wife of Brently Mallard. Later, as she is processing the "death" of her husband, she regained her name Louise, which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. She admits that her husband wasn't really cruel to her, but the fact is that she had lost her identity and will after her marriage. And then the conclusion of the story hits home the tragedy of Mrs. Mallard's role as a woman when again, the existence of her husband deprives her of life. <br> <br> 
 3. The character of Louise Mallard. <br> <br> 
 In the beginning of the story “The Story of an Hour” Mrs. Mallard is known simply by her married name. A wife who suffers from "heart trouble," she is described as young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines bespoke repression and even a certain strength. When Mrs. Mallard learns of her husband's death, she becomes "Louise," a woman aware of her own desires, enjoying the prospect of being freed from the confines of marriage. Only a woman who had looked to find her own purpose in life, as Chopin was forced to do, would be able to verbalize the irony that Louise dies not because she is weak; she dies from the devastations of knowing freedom for an hour and realizing it has been snatched from her hands, so that she must now return to her life of purposelessness. More accurately, she died not from a weak heart in the face of joy, but from a broken heart at the loss of joy. <br> <br> 
 4. The thoughts that flashed through Mrs. Mallard's mind, after realizing her husband's death. <br> <br> 
 After realizing Louise husband's death, she feels numb and in shock at first, and she goes to her room alone to process the loss. Once she is alone, she notices the beautiful, thriving natural world outside her window, and she begins to feel hopeful. She thinks about how much time she will have for herself now that she has no husband. She whispers to herself, "Free! Body and soul free!".She thinks about her life and realizes now that her husband is gone, she has the freedom to do as she pleases when she pleases. Although her husband has never been mean or abusive to her, he has totally controlled her life, so much so that Louise dreaded the future. It is unfortunate that her hopes for a wonderful future last less than an hour when she saw her husband was alive, and she dies at the very moment. <br> <br> 
5. Comment on the climax of “The Story of an Hour”. <br> <br> 
 At the end of the story, Louise is very much looking forward to her future as a widow, but as she leaves her room to go downstairs, Brently Mallard opens the door and walks into the house. There was a mistake, and he was not on the train. Louise dies in shock, and ironically, it is assumed that she died of "the joy that kills." The witnesses assume she was so happy to see her husband alive that she died of the shock. Readers know that she is shocked to learn that the future that she had just dreamed of, "all sorts of days that would be her own," will now be impossible. <br> <br>  IV. Answer the following questions in about 300 words: <br> <br> 
 1. Kate Chopin's “The Story of an Hour” is an attempt to highlight inherent oppressiveness of marriage. Discuss. <br> <br> 
 The short story "The Story of an Hour” by Kate Chopin shows a different point of view about marriage. The story tells about the reality facing by married women, who were not masters of their fate. They relied on their husbands for financial support and were expected to do a great deal in return. We see that the problem lies not with the individuals but with marriage itself. Even if the husband is kind, even if he means well, he still has the power in the relationship. Therefore, the wife is always the lesser party. She always must bend to his will and she must live for him rather than for herself. A feminist critique shows how marriage does not allow this woman to feel any sense of freedom or individuality. Bringing this inequality between genders to the forefront is one of the main goals of this story. <br> <br> 
 This short story focuses on the treatment of marriage and family more specifically women's identity after her marriages. The protagonist's oppression is shown in the first sentence where she is named "Mrs. Mallard", she is only referred to as the wife of Brently Mallard. Later, as she is processing the "death" of her husband, she regained her name Louise, which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature. She admits that her husband wasn't really cruel to her, but the fact is that she had lost her identity and will after her marriage. And then in the conclusion of the story Mrs. Mallard's role as a wife starts again. But her heart stopped at the thought of going back to the repressive life in a male dominated society. So we know that Louise does not die of "joy" at the news her husband was still alive, as the doctors believed. <br> <br> 
 2. The 'internal' or 'external' conflict in the short story 'The Story of an Hour.'<br> <br> 
 The fundamental conflict in Chopin's work is the idea of what is supposed to be experienced as opposed to what is experienced. Louise finds herself poised between these incommensurate ends when she is told of her husband's death. The socially conditioned response is for her to mourn his passing, but the personal response which responds the essence of her conflict is the newly discovered freedom and sense of self that is now upon her. This becomes a critical conflict within Louise. While experiencing the loss of her husband provides one set of responses, the new definition of self which awaits her gives her another set of responses. This conflict between social conditioning and personal experience represents a fundamental battle within Louise. <br> <br>  The conflict in Kate Chopin's short story "The Story of an Hour" is entirely expressed through the thoughts of Mrs. Mallard -- the report of her husband's death makes her, perhaps for the first time, understand how she has been feeling all this time. That self-awareness -- that thing "too subtle and elusive to name" -- is achieved when she utters the words "free, free, free!" That Mrs. Mallard has indeed been dominated by men, as the previous poster, and by the rigid social conventions for women of her class at the turn of the century can be seen in how she is treated in the story. Her husband's friend is the first to hear and deliver the news of the accident and the one who tries to "screen" the husband from the wife's view. Her sister is the one who breaks the news to her and pleads to be allowed into her locked room. Everyone seems to act on her; she does almost nothing physical, on her own, in the story. <br> <br> 
Over the course of an hour, she moves from shock over the loss of her husband to feelings of joy and freedom. The conflict is between the societal expectation she has conformed to all of these years with her husband and her own needs and desires. There is nothing in the story to indicate that she has ever expressed her wants and needs in the marriage, she has rather repressed these over its course.
